Train Scheduler is an application that uses Fierbase to host the arrival and departure data for various trains. The application retrieves this information from Firebase and manipulates it through the use of Moment.js. The webpage provides real time information about various trains including arrival times and how many minutes remain until each train's arrival. Additionally, the user is able to create their own trains to keep track of their data.

### How It Works
* Observe each train's name, destination, frequency, next arrival, and how minutes remaining until arrival for each prepopulated train.
* Type and submit the fields to create a train of your choice and observe the aforementioned data for it.

### Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* HTML
* CSS
* Firebase
* Moment.js
